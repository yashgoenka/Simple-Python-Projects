# Simple-Python-Projects
These projects were assignments for a computer science course at University of California, Berkeley. 

**Ants** is a tower defense game called *Ants Vs. SomeBees*.

**Hog** is a simulator with multiple strategies for the dice game Hog.

**Maps** or *Yelp Maps* creates a Voronoi diagram (visualization) of restaurant ratings using machine learning and the Yelp academic dataset. In this visualization, Berkeley is segmented into regions, where each region is shaded by the predicted rating of the closest restaurant (yellow is 5 stars, blue is 1 star).
